When we want to migrate our database from mongodb to postgreas or my sql the database we would have to hcnage but the thing all that headache is not our responsibility we ony need to worry about the writhing of that primsa


All that queries that need to be written are done by prisma itself and also if there is any migration or alteration that is also auto done by prisma in th migrations folder that is not our headache
